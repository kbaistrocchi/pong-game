# Pong Game

A JavaScript program that uses SVGs to create a basic pong game. 

## Setup

Ensure you have Yarn installed. 
    To install Yarn, first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    Once Homebrew is installed, type `brew install yarn` into Terminal

**Run locally with the Yarn server:**

In the Terminal, navigate into project folder and type `yarn start`

Once you run the start command you can play the game at (http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Left player: use `a` to move paddle up and `z` to move paddle down.

Right player: use `up arrow` key to move paddle up and `down arrow` key to move paddle down

**Rules**

To score, get the ball past your opponent's paddle.
If the ball hits the yellow star, the winning player loses 2 points and the ball resets in the middle of the board. The star then relocates.

### Personal Learnings

The project helped me learn how to use JavaScript classes and modules correctly. Modules only work when running on a server. This was also my first use of SVGs and manipulating them via JavaScript.

I became familiar with basic usage of Homebrew and Yarn as a package manager.
